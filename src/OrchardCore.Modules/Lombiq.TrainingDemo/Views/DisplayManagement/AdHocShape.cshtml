@* The shape tag helper will render a shape in the markup. The type attribute will be the shape type which is mapped
   primarily from cshtml or liquid files (there are other ways of creating shape types but it will be described later).
   The following attributes will be actual parameters in a dynamic view model passed to the shape. *@

<shape type="TestShape" name="John Doe" age="26" />

@* NEXT STATION: Views/TestShape.cshtml *@
